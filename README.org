This was a 9 day (2.5hr/day) experiment to learn how to procedurally generate maps on a sphere. I hadn't worked with this type of sphere geometry before and wanted to learn.

** Geometry

[[https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1842-delaunay-voronoi-sphere/][Writeup]] - Fibonacci points, Delaunay triangles, Voronoi regions

** Maps

[[https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1843-planet-generation/][Writeup]] - tectonic plates, mountains, oceans, biomes, rivers, rendering
