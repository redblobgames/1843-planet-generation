This was a 9 day (2.5hr/day) experiment to learn how to procedurally generate maps on a sphere. I hadn't worked with this type of sphere geometry before and wanted to learn.

** Geometry

[[https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1842-delaunay-voronoi-sphere/][Writeup]] - Fibonacci points, Delaunay triangles, Voronoi regions

** Maps

[[https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1843-planet-generation/][Writeup]] - tectonic plates, mountains, oceans, biomes, rivers, rendering

** Installation

To run in devel mode:

#+begin_src sh
yarn global add browserify watchify budo
yarn install
yarn watch
#+end_src

Then visit the budo url (probably [[http://localhost:9966/embed.html]]).

Alernatively, if you use npm instead of yarn:

#+begin_src sh
npm -g install browserify watchify budo
npm install
npm run watch
#+end_src

In production mode, run ~yarn build~ or ~npm run build~ and visit embed.html .
